🧠 Project Title
“Surrogate Neural Model for EMI Spectrum Prediction of EV Power Converters Using Wide Bandgap MOSFETs: A Deep Learning and AWS-Based Continuous Learning Approach”

🔍 Core Thesis Goal
To develop a supervised multi-output regression surrogate model that:

Learns to predict EMI-relevant metrics from MOSFET & simulation data

Adapts continuously to new data (online learning or periodic updates)

Trains separate pathways for each target output internally for fine-grained accuracy

Uses Optuna for hyperparameter optimization

Deployed using AWS SageMaker, S3, EC2, and CloudWatch

Achieves >99% accuracy per output

🧱 Architecture Blueprint
📁 Dataset Inputs
Category	Columns
MOSFET Specs	DeviceID, Qg, Qgd, Coss, VGS_th_max, etc.
Simulation Params	Vbus, Rg, Ls4...Ls11
Derived Features	Qgd_Qgs_ratio, Coss_Ciss_ratio, etc.
Targets (13)	voltage_rise_time_pulse1, ..., ringing_frequency_MHz

⚙️ Model Architecture: Modular ANN (Multi-output)
Each target is treated with its own dense head for flexibility. This approach is inspired by multi-task learning with task-specific heads.

✅ Next Action
Would you like me to now start with the actual code base from Step 1:

Load and preprocess your sample

Feature reduction using importance

Then move to Optuna + ANN architecture?

I can generate modular scripts ready to scale to your full 5L row dataset. Let’s build this brilliantly.

 Project Execution Plan: Surrogate Model with Generalization to New MOSFETs
🧾 Input Assumptions
Component	Description
Training Data	5 MOSFETs × 100k simulations = 500k rows
Test Data	1 unseen MOSFET = 100k rows
Input Features	MOSFET specs, simulation inputs, derived features (65 total)
Output Variables	13 EMI characteristics (continuous)

🧱 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION PIPELINE
✅ STEP 1: Data Preparation
text
Copy
Edit
Goal: Load data → Clean → Normalize → Split
Combine all 5 training MOSFETs into one DataFrame

Drop DeviceID (or one-hot encode if necessary for auxiliary use)

Apply StandardScaler to all features (important for ANN)

Identify the 13 output columns

Split train vs validation (e.g., 80-20 split)

Separate the 6th MOSFET’s data as holdout test set

✅ STEP 2: Feature Selection (Optional but Recommended)
text
Copy
Edit
Goal: Reduce dimensions to avoid overfitting and improve performance
Use tree-based feature importance (Random Forest/XGBoost)

Keep top-K most relevant features (e.g., 30–40)

Save feature list for consistent application to test data

✅ STEP 3: Build a Multi-Output Neural Network
text
Copy
Edit
Goal: Shared representation → Individual output heads
Input Layer

Shared Dense Layers (e.g., 2–4 layers)

Separate Dense heads for each of 13 output variables

Use ReLU for shared layers, linear for heads

🔧 Loss: MeanSquaredError
🔧 Optimizer: Adam/Nadam/SGD (to be tuned)
🔧 Metrics: MAE, R², RMSE for each output

✅ STEP 4: Tune with Optuna
text
Copy
Edit
Goal: Find best hyperparameters using multi-objective optimization
Search space:

Layers: 2–5

Neurons/layer: 64–512

Activation: ReLU, Tanh

Optimizer: Adam, Nadam, SGD

Batch size: 32–256

Learning rate: 1e-5 to 1e-2

Evaluation Metric:

Mean R² across 13 outputs (or custom weighted score)

✅ STEP 5: Continuous Learning Setup
text
Copy
Edit
Goal: Allow model to retrain or update as new data is fed
Options:

Partial learning: Append new batch → .fit() few epochs (fine-tune)

Transfer learning: Freeze shared base, retrain heads

Save model + optimizer state after each update

💡 Keep model architecture modular:

python
Copy
Edit
shared_base = build_shared_layers()
output_heads = [Dense(1, name=f"output_{i}")(shared_base) for i in range(13)]
✅ STEP 6: Evaluate on Unseen MOSFET
text
Copy
Edit
Goal: Test model generalization on new device
Use saved feature scaler and structure

Predict EMI characteristics on unseen MOSFET

Plot predicted vs actual for each output

Report R², MAE per output

✅ Success Criteria: 99% accuracy (R² > 0.99) on each target

✅ STEP 7: AWS Deployment & Automation
text
Copy
Edit
Goal: Make it usable, scalable, and traceable
Use S3 to upload new MOSFET/simulation data

Use AWS Lambda to trigger training when file uploaded

Train on SageMaker or GPU-based EC2

Deploy prediction API using SageMaker Endpoint

Monitor metrics using CloudWatch

Store model versions and logs in EFS or S3

✅ STEP 8: Visualization and Monitoring
text
Copy
Edit
Goal: Explainable & User-friendly insights

Optuna trial history

Visualize in AWS or local dashboard
